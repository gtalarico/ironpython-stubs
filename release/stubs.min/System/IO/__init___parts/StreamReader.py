  Close(self: StreamReader)
   Closes the System.IO.StreamReader object and the underlying stream,and releases any 
    system resources associated with the reader.

  Dispose(self: StreamReader,disposing: bool)
   Closes the underlying stream,releases the unmanaged resources used by the 
    System.IO.StreamReader,and optionally releases the managed resources.
  
  
   disposing: true to release both managed and unmanaged resources; false to release only unmanaged 
    resources.

 def MemberwiseClone(self,*args):
  """
  MemberwiseClone(self: MarshalByRefObject,cloneIdentity: bool) -> MarshalByRefObject
  
   Creates a shallow copy of the current System.MarshalByRefObject object.
  
   cloneIdentity: false to delete the current System.MarshalByRefObject object's identity,which will cause 
    the object to be assigned a new identity when it is marshaled across a remoting boundary. 
    A value of false is usually appropriate. true to copy the current 
    System.MarshalByRefObject object's identity to its clone,which will cause remoting 
    client calls to be routed to the remote server object.
  
   Returns: A shallow copy of the current System.MarshalByRefObject object.
  MemberwiseClone(self: object) -> object
  
   Creates a shallow copy of the current System.Object.
   Returns: A shallow copy of the current System.Object.

  Read(self: StreamReader) -> int
  
   Reads the next character from the input stream and advances the character position by one 
    character.
  
   Returns: The next character from the input stream represented as an System.Int32 object,or -1 if 
    no more characters are available.
  
  Read(self: StreamReader,index: int,count: int) -> (int,Array[Char])
  
   Reads a specified maximum of characters from the current stream into a buffer,beginning 
    at the specified index.
  
  
   index: The index of buffer at which to begin writing.
   count: The maximum number of characters to read.
   Returns: The number of characters that have been read,or 0 if at the end of the stream and no 
    data was read. The number will be less than or equal to the count parameter,depending on 
    whether the data is available within the stream.
