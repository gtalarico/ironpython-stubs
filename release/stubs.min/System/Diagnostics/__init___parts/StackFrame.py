  GetFileColumnNumber(self: StackFrame) -> int
  
   Gets the column number in the file that contains the code that is executing. This

  """
  GetILOffset(self: StackFrame) -> int
  
   Gets the offset from the start of the Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code for the

    not the just-in-time (JIT) compiler is generating debugging code. The generation of this 
    debugging information is controlled by the System.Diagnostics.DebuggableAttribute.
  
   Returns: The offset from the start of the MSIL code for the method that is executing.

  GetNativeOffset(self: StackFrame) -> int
  
   Gets the offset from the start of the native just-in-time (JIT)-compiled code for the
