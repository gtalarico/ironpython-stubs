  Add(pointer: UIntPtr,offset: int) -> UIntPtr
  
   Adds an offset to the value of an unsigned pointer.
  
   pointer: The unsigned pointer to add the offset to.

  Equals(self: UIntPtr,obj: object) -> bool
  
   Returns a value indicating whether this instance is equal to a specified object.
