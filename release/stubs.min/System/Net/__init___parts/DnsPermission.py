  Copy(self: DnsPermission) -> IPermission

  FromXml(self: DnsPermission,securityElement: SecurityElement)
   Reconstructs a System.Net.DnsPermission instance from an XML encoding.

  Intersect(self: DnsPermission,target: IPermission) -> IPermission
  
   Creates a permission instance that is the intersection of the current permission instance

   Returns: A System.Net.DnsPermission instance that represents the intersection of the current 
    System.Net.DnsPermission instance with the specified System.Net.DnsPermission instance,
    or null if the intersection is empty. If both the current instance and target are

    the security object,including state information.

  Union(self: DnsPermission,target: IPermission) -> IPermission
  
   Creates a permission instance that is the union of the current permission instance and
