    specified culture-specific formatting information.
  
  
   value: An object that implements the System.IConvertible interface.
   provider: An object that supplies culture-specific formatting information.
   Returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer that is equivalent to value,or zero if value is null.
  ToUInt64(value: int) -> UInt64
  
   Converts the value of the specified 32-bit signed integer to an equivalent 64-bit 
    unsigned integer.
  
  
   value: The 32-bit signed integer to convert.
   Returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer that is equivalent to value.
  ToUInt64(value: str,fromBase: int) -> UInt64
  
   Converts the string representation of a number in a specified base to an equivalent 
    64-bit unsigned integer.
  
  
   value: A string that contains the number to convert.
   fromBase: The base of the number in value,which must be 2,8,10,or 16.
   Returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer that is equivalent to the number in value,or 0 (zero) if value 
    is null.
