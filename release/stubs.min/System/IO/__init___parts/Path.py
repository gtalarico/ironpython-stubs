  ChangeExtension(path: str,extension: str) -> str
  
   Changes the extension of a path string.
  
   path: The path information to modify. The path cannot contain any of the characters defined in 
    System.IO.Path.GetInvalidPathChars.
  
   extension: The new extension (with or without a leading period). Specify null to remove an existing 
    extension from path.
  
   Returns: The modified path information.On Windows-based desktop platforms,if path is null or an 
    empty string (""),the path information is returned unmodified. If extension is null,the 
    returned string contains the specified path with its extension removed. If path has no 
    extension,and extension is not null,the returned path string contains extension 
    appended to the end of path.
