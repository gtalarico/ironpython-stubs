  Add(self: CredentialCache,uriPrefix: Uri,authType: str,cred: NetworkCredential)
   Adds a System.Net.NetworkCredential instance to the credential cache for use with

    prefix and authentication protocol.
  
  
   uriPrefix: A System.Uri that specifies the URI prefix of the resources that the credential grants 
    access to.

   cred: The System.Net.NetworkCredential to add to the credential cache.
  Add(self: CredentialCache,host: str,port: int,authenticationType: str,credential: NetworkCredential)
   Adds a System.Net.NetworkCredential instance for use with SMTP to the credential cache 
    and associates it with a host computer,port,and authentication protocol. Credentials 
    added using this method are valid for SMTP only. This method does not work for HTTP or 
    FTP requests.

   port: A System.Int32 that specifies the port to connect to on host.
