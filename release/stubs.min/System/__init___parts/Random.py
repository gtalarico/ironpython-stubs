  Next(self: Random) -> int
  
   Returns a nonnegative random number.
   Returns: A 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to zero and less than System.Int32.MaxValue.
  Next(self: Random,minValue: int,maxValue: int) -> int
  
   Returns a random number within a specified range.
  
   minValue: The inclusive lower bound of the random number returned.
   maxValue: The exclusive upper bound of the random number returned. maxValue must be greater than or 
    equal to minValue.
  
   Returns: A 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to minValue and less than maxValue; that 
    is,the range of return values includes minValue but not maxValue. If minValue equals 
    maxValue,minValue is returned.
  
  Next(self: Random,maxValue: int) -> int
  
   Returns a nonnegative random number less than the specified maximum.
  
   maxValue: The exclusive upper bound of the random number to be generated. maxValue must be greater 
    than or equal to zero.
  
   Returns: A 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to zero,and less than maxValue; that is,
    the range of return values ordinarily includes zero but not maxValue. However,if 
    maxValue equals zero,maxValue is returned.
